# P3-APCS-Attendance-App

Simple iOS app I developed to make taking attendance more easier especially when students may not be sitting in their assigned seat. This app allows the user to click on each seat represented by a button, which toggles between marked present (green) and absent (red). There is also a switch at the bottom that can be toggled between displaying students' initials and not displaying them.

<table>
  <tr>

    <td><img src="attendanceWithInitials.png" alt="Image 2 description"></td>
    
  </tr>
</table>
